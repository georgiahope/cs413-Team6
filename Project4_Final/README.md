# Project 4 - Final Project
## Title: Christmas Cleanup
* Georgia Buchanan (ghb23)
* Jessie Gardner (jlp429)
* Vidal Martinez (vrm55)
## Instructions
The main player (you) plays as the roomba. Your goal is to pick up as many dirt piles as you can; once you have collected enough dirt piles, you win! However, watch out for the cats! Depending on the level of difficulty chosen, if you bump into any cats they will only create a bigger mess by pooping on the floor and they will make you lose the game if you bump into them enough times. Have fun and cleanup in time for Christmas morning!
## Known	Bugs	or	Issues
The roomba sometimes will only pick up dirt piles on a certain side of the roomba.
## Credits
*	Jessie Gardner:	Created cat sprites, poop sprites, rug sprite and fire place/fir sprites.
Created pathways for cats.
Created state machine for cats as well as the collisions for the roomba and cats.
Created the jingle sound and the cat sounds.
*	Georgia Buchanan:	Created rooms and graphics for the following rooms: title room, instruction room, level of difficulty room, win screen, and text for failed room. Created tile map for main playing rooms. Created menu for start screen and menu for choosing level of difficulty. Created animated sprites for snow, lights, and the christmas tree. Created christmas-theme sprites for all rooms - decoration. Coded instructions dialogue box to appear on the instruction screen. Created the Christmas game background audio.
*	Vidal Martinez:	 I created the sprite art for the roomba, wall, door, fail screen, dirt, dirt bar, bullet. The code for rommba movement updated the cat paths to use generated linear steps for difficulty 3 and predefined paths for lower difficulties, generate cats, respawning cats, the bullet functionality, picking up dirt with win condition, hitting cat for lose condition, collision with cats, difficulty for playrooms, room collision/collision tiles, and cat object has randomized sprite image.
