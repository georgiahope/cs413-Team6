* Vidal Martinez (vrm55)
##	Instructions
The main player (you) plays as the turkey and your goal is to reach to the top by jumping and landing on colored blocks.
The colored blocks is what keeps the music playing, if you step on a regular block with no color background on it the music stops and you will be returned to the ground to start again. You will have 3 attempts to reach the top before you fail. Use arrows and the spacebar to move around and jump.
It is Thanksgiving, so enjoy the celebration music while staying alive, but beware of the hunstman trying to get you, the sound of gun shots mean they are close!!
##	Known	Bugs	or	Issues
In the older versions of our game we had bullets working to shoot at the turkey while it tries to reach the top. However with the updated versions that use physics on the turkey and scaled up backgrounds and sprites, it has stopped working. It took some time to identify why and we ran out of time trying to fix it so we decided to leave the object there as is.
