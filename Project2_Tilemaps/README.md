##	Instructions
The game opens into an eerie neighborhood not unlike your own. You are dressed as
a ghost with your candy sack in hand. The object of the game is to collect as
many candies as possible before the timer at the top of the screen reaches 3 minutes.
Seems easy enough, however, there are irate parents out to ruin the fun. Be sure not
to get caught or they will take away your candy!
