##	Game	Title: Halloween Escape

##	Instructions
The game opens into an eerie neighborhood not unlike your own. You are dressed as
a ghost with your candy sack in hand. The object of the game is to collect as
many candies as possible before the timer at the top of the screen reaches 3 minutes.
Seems easy enough, however, there are irate parents out to ruin the fun. Be sure not
to get caught or they will take away your candy!

##	Known	Bugs	or	Issues
The main player is able to go outside the boundaries of the tilemap. We had trouble setting that boundary so the player couldn't leave the screen completely.
